I had illustrated a quantitative framework to measure the lifecycle value of a new loan portfolio. Based on assumed parameters, there are factors significantly impact the valuation of a project. I wan to test the hypothesis that, due to marketing and operation costs, loan portfolio may not yield profit in the first years but will generate profits afterwards, if you keep relending to the old customers(perpetual loan?). I believe it's not true(perpetual loan is not feasible and just an illusion). You should help me find out under which conditions, will this happen. If possible, help me estimate the prior probability of this case.
