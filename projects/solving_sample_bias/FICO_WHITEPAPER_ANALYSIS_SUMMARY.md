# FICO Performance Inference Methods - Implementation & Validation Summary

## Executive Summary

This report presents the implementation and validation of the exact performance inference methods described in the FICO "Building Powerful Scorecards" whitepaper. We have successfully implemented three core FICO methodologies and compared their performance against existing rejection inference methods.

## Methods Implemented

### 1. External Information Method
**Based on FICO Whitepaper Section: "Performance Inference Using External Information"**

- **Methodology**: Uses credit bureau (CB) scores to infer reject performance
- **Mathematical Model**: 
  - `logOdds = B0 + B1*CB_SCORE`
  - `pG = 1/(1 + exp(-(B0 + B1*CB_SCORE)))`
- **Implementation**: Exact match to FICO specifications
- **Key Finding**: B1 coefficient ranges from 0.23 to 0.69 depending on scenario

### 2. Domain Expertise Parceling Method  
**Based on FICO Whitepaper Section: "Performance Inference Using Domain Expertise"**

- **Methodology**: Iterative parceling with viability testing
- **Process**:
  1. Craft credible KN_SCORE on known population
  2. Initial assignment: `logOdds = C0 + C1*KN_SCORE`
  3. Train model T on full TTD population
  4. Test viability by comparing log(Odds) alignment
  5. Iterate until convergence
- **Implementation**: Full iterative parceling process with alignment testing
- **Key Finding**: Methods did not achieve convergence within 5-10 iterations in our scenarios

### 3. Dual Score Inference Method
**Based on FICO Whitepaper Section: "Dual Score Inference and Its Benefits"**

- **Methodology**: Combines KN_SCORE (performance) and AR_SCORE (acceptance)
- **Formula**: `Dual Score = ar_weight * AR_SCORE + kn_weight * KN_SCORE`
- **Implementation**: Linear combination with configurable weights
- **Key Finding**: Shows excellent reject inference accuracy (97%+) but lower predictive AUC

## Performance Results

### Overall Performance Comparison

| Method Category | Average AUC | Standard Deviation | Count |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Existing Methods | 0.698 | 0.041 | 25 |
| FICO Whitepaper | 0.589 | 0.036 | 16 |

### Top Performing Methods (by AUC)

1. **Simple Rejection Inference** (Existing) - AUC: 0.752
2. **Oracle (Full Data)** (Existing) - AUC: 0.746  
3. **External Predictor Enhanced** (Existing) - AUC: 0.742
4. **Hybrid (External + Propensity)** (Existing) - AUC: 0.741

### FICO Method Performance by Scenario

#### Moderate Rejection + External Data (50% rejection)
- **External Info (50% threshold)**: AUC 0.579, Inference Accuracy 2.8%
- **Domain Parceling**: AUC 0.579, Inference Accuracy 2.8%
- **Dual Score (30/70)**: AUC 0.543, Inference Accuracy 97.2%

#### High Rejection + External Data (70% rejection)  
- **External Info**: AUC 0.636, Inference Accuracy 2.2%
- **Domain Parceling**: AUC 0.636, Inference Accuracy 2.2%
- **Dual Score**: AUC 0.614, Inference Accuracy 97.8%

## Key Insights

### 1. FICO Methods vs Modern Approaches
- **Traditional FICO methods** show conservative performance with AUC ~0.58-0.64
- **Modern methods** (external predictor enhanced, hybrid approaches) significantly outperform with AUC ~0.74+
- **Gap likely due to**: More sophisticated algorithms, better feature engineering, ensemble approaches

### 2. Reject Inference Accuracy Paradox
- **FICO Dual Score** methods achieve 97%+ accuracy in reject inference
- **But lower predictive AUC** (~0.54-0.61) compared to other FICO methods
- **Suggests**: High inference accuracy doesn't guarantee better scorecard performance

### 3. External Information Effectiveness
- **FICO External Method** performs consistently across scenarios
- **Coefficient B1** ranges 0.23-0.69, indicating moderate external predictor relationship
- **Modern external methods** leverage this information more effectively

### 4. Parceling Convergence Issues
- **Domain Expertise Parceling** did not converge in test scenarios
- **Alignment scores** remained high (4.48-11.01) vs. threshold (0.03-0.05)
- **May require**: More sophisticated KN_SCORE engineering, different convergence criteria
