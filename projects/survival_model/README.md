# SME Lending Survival Model and Decision Engine

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive SME (Small and Medium Enterprise) lending platform that combines survival analysis, profit optimization, market factors risk assessment, and **decision transparency** to make optimal lending decisions. The system has evolved through multiple phases to become a sophisticated, market-aware decision engine with full explainability for daily managers.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Credit Survival Model** (`credit_survival_model.py`)
   - Cox proportional hazards regression with time-varying covariates
   - Payment pattern analysis (installment, balloon, interest-only)
   - C-index performance: ~0.86 with payment pattern integration

2. **Joint 4-Variable Optimization Engine** (`enhanced_decision_engine.py`)
   - Optimizes across 4 dimensions: loan amount, pricing, payment pattern, term
   - 450 combinations per borrower (5×5×3×6)
   - Advanced risk management with multi-dimensional constraints

3. **Market Factors Risk Model** (`market_factors.py`)
   - 24 systematic risk factors across 4 categories
   - Real-time data integration from FRED API and Yahoo Finance
   - Industry-specific risk adjustments and portfolio management

4. **Decision Transparency System** (`decision_explainer.py`) **[NEW]**
   - Multi-level explanations (executive, manager, technical)
   - Plain English translation of complex algorithmic decisions
   - LLM integration for enhanced narrative generation
   - Actionable business recommendations and next steps

5. **Profit Optimization Framework** (`loan_term_profit_optimizer.py`)
   - Expected profit calculations with survival probability integration
   - Risk-adjusted return optimization
   - Portfolio-level concentration management

## Key Features

### Advanced Decision Science
- **4-Variable Joint Optimization**: Simultaneously optimizes loan amount (75%-130% of requested), pricing strategies (-150bps to +200bps), payment patterns (3 types), and loan terms (6 options)
- **Market-Aware Risk Assessment**: Integrates macroeconomic, market, industry, and regional factors for dynamic risk adjustment
- **Survival Analysis Integration**: Cox hazard model with C-index of 0.86 for default probability prediction

### Decision Transparency & Explainability **[NEW]**
- **Multi-Level Explanations**: Executive summaries, manager analysis, and technical deep-dives
- **Plain English Translation**: Converts statistical outputs to business language
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI and Anthropic API integration for enhanced explanations
- **Actionable Insights**: Specific recommendations for loan officers and managers

### Market Factors Integration
- **Comprehensive Risk Coverage**: 24 factors including GDP growth, unemployment, Fed funds rate, VIX volatility, credit spreads, industry metrics
- **Automated Data Updates**: Real-time integration with public APIs (FRED, Yahoo Finance)
- **Industry-Specific Analysis**: Tailored risk assessments for technology, retail, construction, manufacturing, and services sectors
- **Scenario Analysis**: Dynamic stress testing across different economic conditions

### Performance Metrics
- **Approval Rate**: 8.0% (highly selective for quality)
- **Average Expected Profit**: $4,263 per approved loan
- **Average Annualized Return**: 8.39%

# Initialize explainer
explainer = DecisionExplainer()

# Generate manager-level explanation
explanation = explainer.explain_loan_decision(
    borrower_data={
        'name': 'TechCorp Solutions',
        'loan_amount': 75000,
        'credit_score': 750,
        'debt_to_income': 0.25,
        'years_in_business': 5,
        'industry': 'technology'
    },
    loan_terms={
        'amount_strategy': 'standard',
        'pricing_strategy': 'premium',
        'payment_pattern': 'installment',
        'term_months': 36
    },
    detail_level='manager'
)

print(f"Decision: {explanation['decision']}")
print(f"Risk Level: {explanation['borrower_analysis']['overall_profile']}")

# Manager recommendations
for rec in explanation['manager_recommendations']:
    print(f"• {rec}")
```

### LLM-Enhanced Explanations

```python
from llm_enhanced_demo import LLMEnhancedExplainer

# Initialize with LLM integration
explainer = LLMEnhancedExplainer(
    openai_api_key="your_openai_key"  # or anthropic_api_key
)

# Generate executive-level explanation with LLM enhancement
explanation = explainer.explain_loan_decision(
    borrower_data, loan_terms, detail_level='executive'
)

# Access LLM-enhanced insights
strategic_insights = explanation['llm_insights']['strategic_analysis']
print(strategic_insights)
```

### Market Factors Risk Assessment

```python
from market_factors import MarketFactorsContainer

# Initialize market factors
market_factors = MarketFactorsContainer()

# Update current conditions
market_factors.update_factor_manual('unemployment_rate', 3.7)
market_factors.update_factor_manual('fed_funds_rate', 5.25)

# Get risk adjustment for specific industry
risk_multiplier = market_factors.get_portfolio_risk_adjustment(industry='technology')
print(f"Technology sector risk multiplier: {risk_multiplier:.3f}")

# Generate comprehensive risk report
report = market_factors.generate_risk_report(industry='technology')
