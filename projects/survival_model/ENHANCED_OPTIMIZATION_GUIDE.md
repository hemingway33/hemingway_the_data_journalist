## Framework Architecture

### 1. Four-Dimensional Decision Space

**Comprehensive optimization across all loan parameters**:

```python
# 4-Variable Decision Space
loan_amount_strategies = {
    'conservative': 0.75,   # 75% of requested amount
    'moderate': 0.85,       # 85% of requested amount
    'standard': 1.0,        # 100% of requested amount
    'generous': 1.15,       # 115% of requested amount
    'aggressive': 1.3       # 130% of requested amount
}

pricing_strategies = {
    'competitive': -0.015,   # -150 bps (competitive pricing)
    'market': -0.005,        # -50 bps (slight discount)
    'standard': 0.0,         # Base rate (standard pricing)
    'premium': 0.01,         # +100 bps (premium pricing)
    'high_margin': 0.02      # +200 bps (high margin)
}

payment_patterns = ['installment', 'balloon', 'interest_only']
loan_terms = [24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84]
```

### 2. Integrated Optimization Engine

**Joint evaluation process for all combinations**:

```python
# Comprehensive 4-variable evaluation
for amount_strategy, pricing_strategy, pattern, term in product(
    amount_strategies, pricing_strategies, payment_patterns, terms):
    
    # Calculate actual loan parameters
    actual_amount = requested_amount * amount_multipliers[amount_strategy]
    interest_rate = (base_rate + pattern_premium + 
                    term_adjustment + pricing_adjustment)
    
    # Evaluate loan-specific metrics
    loan_metrics = calculate_loan_metrics(borrower, actual_amount, interest_rate)
    
    # Apply multi-layer business criteria
    if meets_all_criteria(loan_metrics, profit_analysis):
        viable_options.append(combination_result)
```

### 3. Enhanced Decision Criteria

**Comprehensive evaluation framework**:

```python
decision_criteria = {
    'min_expected_return': 0.04,        # 4% minimum expected return
    'min_annualized_return': 0.06,      # 6% minimum annualized return  
    'max_default_probability': 0.30,    # 30% maximum default risk
    'min_profit_per_loan': 300,         # $300 minimum profit
    'min_profit_per_month': 15,         # $15 minimum monthly profit
    'min_interest_margin': 0.03,        # 300 bps minimum spread
    'max_loan_to_income_ratio': 0.40,   # 40% max loan-to-income
    'min_debt_service_coverage': 1.25,  # 1.25x minimum coverage
    'max_high_loan_amount_concentration': 0.30,  # 30% max high amounts
    'preferred_amount_range': (0.8, 1.2),        # 80-120% of requested
}
```

### 4. Multi-Dimensional Composite Scoring

**Integrated performance evaluation**:

```python
composite_score = (
    profit_weight * profit_score +           # Total expected profit (40%)
    return_weight * return_score * risk_penalty +  # Risk-adjusted return (30%)
    efficiency_weight * efficiency_score     # Capital efficiency (30%)
) * amount_bonus * margin_bonus              # Structure quality bonuses
```

## Implementation Examples

### Individual 4-Variable Optimization

```python
# Comprehensive borrower evaluation
joint_result = joint_engine.joint_4variable_optimization(
    borrower_data=applicant_profile,
    requested_amount=40000,
    check_portfolio_constraints=True
)

print(f"Decision: {joint_result['decision']}")
print(f"Combinations Evaluated: {joint_result['total_combinations_evaluated']}")

if joint_result['decision'] == 'APPROVE':
    best = joint_result['best_overall']
    
    print(f"Optimal Amount Strategy: {best['amount_strategy']} ({best['amount_multiplier']:.0%})")
    print(f"Actual Amount: ${best['actual_amount']:,.0f}")
    print(f"Pricing Strategy: {best['pricing_strategy']} ({best['pricing_adjustment']:+.1%})")
    print(f"Interest Rate: {best['interest_rate']:.2%}")
    print(f"Payment Pattern: {best['payment_pattern'].title()}")
    print(f"Loan Term: {best['term_months']} months")
    print(f"Expected Profit: ${best['profit_analysis']['expected_profit']:,.0f}")
```
