# Product Requirements Document: Credit Interview Agent

## 1. Introduction

Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) face significant challenges in accessing finance. Current banking product innovation and risk control capabilities often fall short of providing the timely, personalized fund management solutions SMEs require. Furthermore, developing and maintaining the sophisticated decision intelligence systems needed for effective risk management and client operations is hampered by a scarcity of specialized talent. Traditional credit technologies, often lacking a comprehensive "world model" of SME finance and advanced AI thinking, have struggled to resolve the SME financing "impossible trinity" – the difficulty of simultaneously achieving low risk, high accessibility, and manageable costs.

The Credit Interview Agent is an AI-powered system designed to directly address these critical pain points. It aims to revolutionize the credit assessment process by leveraging a deep understanding of SME business finance, generating highly relevant and customized interview questions, and interacting with clients with embodied intelligence. This agent serves not only to streamline interviews but also to enhance risk assessment, provide actionable insights for SMEs, and augment the capabilities of financial institutions in serving the SME sector more effectively.
